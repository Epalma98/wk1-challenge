A webpage for Horiseon social media marketing company.
# wk1-challenge Webpage

## Description

I was given a code for a webpage that had no accessibility and did not follow HTML semantics.

I wanted to refactor this webpage so that I could learn how to add accessibility features to webpages. This allows
webpages to be accessible to people with disabilities which I will definitely be applying in my career.

This refactor not only improves the accessibility, but also makes it easier for other devs to understand what HTML elements align
with the CSS attributes they affect.

I learned that accessibility is important whenever creating a webpage. By adding accessibility, you're making sure people with
disabilities are able to use your webpage and also allows search engines to rank your website higher in searches.

## Usage

Once the webpage is loaded up, there are 3 navigation buttons at the top of the page: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. By clicking on these buttons, you'll be directed to the section of the page where that topic is detailed.

To hear the webpage read aloud, highlight the parts you want read, right click the highlighted section and click "speech". This will tell the browser to start reading the webpage.
